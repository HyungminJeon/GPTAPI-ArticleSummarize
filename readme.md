Hello everyone, welcome to my project: an Article Summarization Website using the OpenAI API!"


In this digital age, information overload is a big problem. Sometimes, we just want to see the summary of the articles to save time. 
My website is designed to provide you with a summary of lengthy articles, enabling you to grasp the essential details without spending a significant amount of time and energy.
Often, chatbot-based summarizers fall short by just analyzing the words in the URL, rather than the actual content. This approach can result in summaries that are not accurate or insightful. 
I've used the 'Article Extractor and Summarizer' API that extracts the actual content from any URL, cleans it up, and then feeds it into the AI for summarization.
The result is an accurate summary of the content that significantly enhances your reading efficiency and comprehension.
One of the challenges I faced while developing this project was utilizing Redux. As a first-time user, I had to spend some time to understand it.
I believe my project contributes to sustainability. By promoting efficient use of time and reducing digital fatigue, I aim to contribute positively to mental health in our hyper-connected society.
Developing this project has been an exciting journey. I see immense potential in my innovation and I'm eager to enhance it with additional features in the future.

Thank you for your attention. 
"Keep an eye out for more innovative solutions from me. Until the next hackathon, stay innovative and keep hacking!"

I've used React, Vite, Javascript, Redux, Rapid API, and Tailwind CSS to complete this project.
